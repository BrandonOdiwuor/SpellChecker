Our team is building a customized spell checker that can work for any language, we start of by building a dictionary from text documents. The spell checker loads words from the dictionary file, which was loaded from the text documents, into a trie data structure which is then used to check for misspelled words in the document. This is an incredibly important problem because it saves a lot of time during typing or texting, saving companies and individuals a lot of money. In addition, it enables people to present official documents free of errors.
