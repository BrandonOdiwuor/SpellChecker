Presents your high-level solution architecture and describes your approach to solving your problem.  This includes a breakdown of your problem into key modules/pieces of functionality, a specification of the algorithm for solving each key piece (you may use structured pseudocode or a flowchart for this), an explanation of the data structures chosen, and why, and a specification of the classes comprising your implementation (you may use UML diagrams here)
