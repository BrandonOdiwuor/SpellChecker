our
team
is
building
a
customized
spell
checker
that
can
work
for
any
language
we
start
of
by
building
a
dictionary
from
text
documents
the
spell
checker
loads
words
from
the
dictionary
file
which
was
loaded
from
the
text
documents
into
a
trie
data
structure
which
is
then
used
to
check
for
misspelled
words
in
the
document
this
is
an
incredibly
important
problem
because
it
saves
a
lot
of
time
during
typing
or
texting
saving
companies
and
individuals
a
lot
of
money
in
addition
it
enables
people
to
present
official
documents
free
of
errors
presents
your
high-level
solution
architecture
and
describes
your
approach
to
solving
your
problem
this
includes
a
breakdown
of
your
problem
into
key
modules
pieces
of
functionality
a
specification
of
the
algorithm
for
solving
each
key
piece
you
may
use
structured
pseudocode
or
a
flowchart
for
this
an
explanation
of
the
data
structures
chosen
and
why
and
a
specification
of
the
classes
comprising
your
implementation
you
may
use
